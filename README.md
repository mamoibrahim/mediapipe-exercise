# Gym Exercise Detector using Mediapipe and Streamlit

This project is a gym exercise detector that utilizes your webcam to track and analyze workout movements. It calculates the angles between body joints using mathematical formulas to count repetitions and provide feedback. If a movement is incomplete, it won't count the repetition. The project also includes a calorie calculator and an articles page.

## Features
- **Exercise Detection**: Detects gym exercises using Mediapipe by analyzing your body's movements via webcam.
- **Rep Counting**: Uses angle measurements between joints to accurately count completed reps.
- **Feedback Mechanism**: If an exercise is not performed correctly, it will notify the user and won't count the rep.
- **Calorie Calculator**: Allows users to calculate calories burned based on their workout.
- **Articles Page**: Provides useful articles related to fitness and health.

## Technologies Used
- **Mediapipe**: For real-time human pose estimation.
- **Streamlit**: To build and host the web application.
- **Python**: Core language for logic and calculations.
