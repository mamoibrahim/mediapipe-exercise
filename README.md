ðŸ’ª Real-Time Exercise Tracker & Repetition Counter
A real-time exercise tracking web application that counts repetitions and provides feedback on form using joint movement analysis.

Built with: Python, MediaPipe, and Streamlit

Model: Utilized Googleâ€™s MediaPipe for real-time joint detection and movement tracking.

Logic: Applied mathematical calculations to measure the angle between three specific joints. A repetition is counted only when the angle reaches a defined threshold, ensuring proper form.

Feedback System: If a movement doesn't meet the required form (based on joint angles), the user receives feedback and the rep is not counted.

Calorie Calculator: Integrated a calorie calculator based on activity and estimated effort.

Web Interface: Built using Streamlit to allow users to interact with the model easily through a browser.

This project combines computer vision and math to help users perform workouts more accurately and track their progress in real-time â€” all from their webcam!

## Technologies Used
- **Mediapipe**: For real-time human pose estimation.
- **Streamlit**: To build and host the web application.
- **Python**: Core language for logic and calculations.
